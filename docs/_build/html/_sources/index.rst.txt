Experimental Robotics Laboratory
===========================================
Assignment 1 Documentation
===========================================
This is the first assignment of the Experimental Robotics Laboratory course, for
the `Robotics Engineering MSc of the University of Genoa
<https://corsi.unige.it/en/corsi/10635>`_.

The goal of this assignment was to simulate, through an ontology, an environment
comprised of rooms and corridors, and to move a robot around these rooms based
on priority mechanisms. A Finite State Machine (FSM) represents the robot state.

The FSM is implemented through the `ROS SMACH library <http://wiki.ros.org/smach>`_,
while the ontology is implemented through the `ARMOR framework
<https://github.com/EmaroLab/armor>`_.
